People work with repositories in GitHub. A repository is like a folder for your project. You can have multiple public and private repositories in GitHub. Repositories can contain files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets. GitHub provides the revision history for all files in a repository.

In general, in GitHub you can:

Host your own open source project. To do this, you create an online repository and add files.
Contribute to an existing open source project that’s public. To do this, you access a copy of the project’s repository, make updates, and request a review of the changes to you want to contribute.
